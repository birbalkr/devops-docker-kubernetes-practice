## 🐳 Docker Commands Cheat Sheet

### 🔹 Docker Basics

```bash
docker --version          # Check Docker version
docker info               # Display Docker system-wide information
docker help               # Show help for Docker commands
```

---

### 🔹 Working with Images

```bash
docker images             # List Docker images
docker build -t <name> .  # Build image from Dockerfile in current directory <name>

docker build: Command to build a Docker image.
    -t <image-name>: Tags the image with a name (e.g., myapp:latest).
    .  The dot refers to the build context, typically the current directory containing the Dockerfile.

docker pull <image>       # Download image from Docker Hub for Ex: docker pull mysql

docker rm <container-id> # You cannot remove an image if a container is currently using it. You may need to stop and remove the associated containers first:

docker rmi <image>        # Remove image

    rmi: Stands for "remove image".
    <image-name-or-id>: # The name or ID of the image you want to delete.

    Example: docker rmi myapp:latest

docker image prune -a  # To remove all unused images:


docker tag <image> <tag>  # Tag image with a new name

    docker tag: Creates a new tag (alias) for an existing image.
    <image>: The name or ID of the existing image.
    <repository>:<tag>: The new name and optional tag for the image.

    Example:  docker tag myapp:latest myusername/myapp:v1.0


## This command tags the local image myapp:latest with a new name myusername/myapp:v1.0, typically used before pushing to Docker Hub or another registry.

docker push myusername/myapp:v1.0

```

---

### 🔹 Working with Containers

```bash

docker run <image>             # Run container from image
    docker run: Creates and starts a new container from the specified image.
    <image>: The image name (optionally with a tag like myapp:latest).

    Example: docker run myapp.

docker run -it <image>         # Run interactively
    -i: Keep STDIN open even if not attached.
    -t: Allocate a pseudo-TTY '(terminal)'.
    Combined as -it, this allows you to interact with the container via the terminal.

    # when you want to run a container and interact with it, e.g., start a shell inside a base image. it's also essential when running a containerized program that requires user input (e.g. read in shell scripts, prompts in Python, etc.).

    Example:
        docker run -it myapp

docker run -d <image>          # Run in detached mode

    -d stands for detached mode.
    This runs the container in the background and prints the container ID.

    Example:
    docker run -d myapp.

docker ps                      # List running containers / Shows all currently running Docker containers.

    # CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                    NAMES
    # a1b2c3d4e5f6   nginx     "nginx -g 'daemon   2 hours ago   Up 2 hours   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp     my-nginx


docker ps -a                   # List all containers / To list all containers (running and stopped) Includes containers that have exited, been stopped, or failed.

docker stop <container>        # Stop a running container / Stops a running container gracefully. You can use the container ID or name.
    Example:
        docker stop myapp

docker start <container>       # Start a stopped container / Starts a container that was previously stopped.
    Example:
    docker start myapp

docker restart <container>     # Restart a container /Stops and then starts the container again. Useful for applying changes like updated environment variables or configs.

    Example:
    docker restart myapp

docker rm <container>          # Remove a container / Removes a stopped container from your system.
    Example:
        docker rm myapp

docker exec -it <container> bash  # Open bash in running container
```

### 🔹 Volumes & Networks

```bash
docker volume create <name>    # Create a volume
docker volume ls               # List volumes
docker network ls              # List networks
docker network create <name>   # Create a network

Absolutely! Below is a **GitHub-friendly section** you can directly paste into your `README.md` file. It uses **your image name (`myapp`)**, and includes clear examples of how to work with **Docker volumes and networks**.
```
---

## 💾 Docker Volumes & Networks (Using `myapp`)

### 📦 Create and Use a Volume

Create a Docker volume:

```bash
docker volume create mydata
```

Run your container with the volume mounted:

```bash
docker run -d -v mydata:/app/data myapp
```

> This mounts the volume `mydata` to the `/app/data` directory inside the `myapp` container.

List all volumes:

```bash
docker volume ls
```

---

### 🌐 Create and Use a Custom Network

List existing networks:

```bash
docker network ls
```

Create a custom network:

```bash
docker network create my-network
```

Run your container in the custom network:

```bash
docker run -d --network my-network --name myapp-container myapp
```

> This connects `myapp` to `my-network` and names the container `myapp-container`.

---

### 🧼 (Optional) Clean Up

Remove a volume:

```bash
docker volume rm mydata
```

Remove a network:

```bash
docker network rm my-network
```

---

✅ Now your `myapp` container can store persistent data and communicate with other services over a custom network!

Let me know if you'd like to include visuals, compose files, or badges for GitHub!
